## Usage

Enter your BIP39 phrase into the 'BIP39 Phrase' field, or press
'Generate Random Phrase'

If required, set the derivation path, although the defaults are quite usable.

See the table for a list of addresses generated from the phrase.

Toggle columns to blank to easily copy/paste a single column of data, eg to
import private keys into a wallet or supply someone with a list of addresses.

Switch between coins to get addresses for: bitcoin, bitcoin-testnet, litecoin, and dogecoin

The BIP32 keys can be used at [bip32.org](https://bip32.org) if desired.
